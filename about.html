			  <a href="https://github.com/tevert"><img src="./res/Tyler.jpg"/><h1 >Tyler Evert</h1></a>
		  </div>
		  <p>Tyler is a burgeoning consultant in the Milwaukee area. He's mostly worked on web applications in the past, largely .NET, but with a smattering of Java. His greatest aspirations are to visit all 7 continents (currently 2/7), and develop upper body strength. </p>
		  
		  <div class="about">          
			  <a href="https://github.com/The9thPatriarch"><img   src="./res/BJ.png"/><h1>Brian "BJ" Kramer</h1></a>
		  </div>
		  <p>Brian is a software consultant with four years of experience developing banking systems.  He aspires to work on difficult algorithms in the backend.  He is also easily recognizable by the foliage sprouting from his lower face. If he were not so easily recognizable as a software engineer,  he could easily be mistaken for shrubbery.</p>

			  <a href="https://github.com/shankera"><img src="./res/Arjun.png"/><h1>Arjun Shanker</h1></a>
		  </div>
		  <p >Arjun works on the native mobile applications for an insurance company, which was helpfully preceded by a year of  WPF and .NET. He is currently drinking himself into oblivion.</p>
